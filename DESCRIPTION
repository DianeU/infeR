Description: This package implements functions to conduct randomization tests in clinical trials. 
    Randomization tests are non-parametric tests that only rely on the randomization distribution 
    of the test statistic. The randomization distribution is induced by the randomization procedure 
    of the clinical trial. The infeR package relies heavily on the randomizeR R package. It 
    implements different test statistics found in the literature and provides a convenient interface 
    to conduct randomization tests, and simulation studies that use randomization tests.
